================
Tonight was the first night all three of us ([Vyki](http://twitter.com/toastergrrl), [JZ](http://twitter.com/jzeta), and [Kurtis](https://twitter.com/krainboltgreene)) were in the same room together.  Though JZ and I are still getting all of our [tools](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/tools/) installed and setup, and despite my kernal headers problem with virtual box, we dove right in.  

We started off with lectures on [semantic versioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning), best practices for ruby gems, and then we started by cloneing the project we will be working on for the summer, [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse). 

In three short hours we managed to:
[learn about oneboxing](http://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-onebox/4546)
>+ create a [discourse-oneboxer branch](https://github.com/dysania/discourse-oneboxer) on our 
+ clone of discourse
+ start namespacing oneboxer to Discourse

Now off to finish my homework, namespacing all of the lib/discourse/oneboxer files to Discourse
