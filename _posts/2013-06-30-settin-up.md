================

This weekend I installed an Ubuntu Linux VM on my Windows 7 laptop and set about going through [Discourse as Your First Rails App](http://blog.discourse.org/2013/04/discourse-as-your-first-rails-app/). I'll basically end up with a VM within a VM...kinda neat but kinda worrisome. Prayin' for ya, my wee ASUS.

Coach Kurtis said to read through [Vagrant's Getting Started guide](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/) as well, since it's what Discourse uses for its VM. Vagrant  provides a configured, portable work environment, so that anyone can simply download it and have it up and running quickly.

So far, I still haven't gotten Vagrant to run the Discourse VM yet since [it keeps hanging](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/wiki/%60vagrant-up%60-hangs-at-%22Waiting-for-VM-to-boot.-This-can-take-a-few-minutes%22). Hope I can get it working soon.

P.S. I wonder if Kurtis would mind if I called him Captain Kurt.
