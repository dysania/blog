[<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/onebox-stats-9-16.png" width="100%" />](http://rubygems.org/gems/onebox)

+ Lots of eyes on us, and lots of work to do still
+ Cleaned up and finished as many open v1.0.0 issues and open pull requests as we could in two hours
  + Learned how to checkout a branch submitted by another author, make edits and merge from the command line
  + A community-submitted onebox! woot. [Peter Hellberg](https://github.com/peterhellberg) submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/127) for a Spotify Onebox, we made a few minor changes and merged
  + Grammar fix [pull request](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/125) submitted by [Kevin Menard](https://github.com/nirvdrum)
  + Changed GitHub Commit Onebox to use Nokogiri instead of OpenGraph, as OpenGraph object didn't include as many details as we would like to preview
  + Renamed all of our engine specs to include "_onebox" in the name for convention's sake
  + Declined a [contribution](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/126) for syntax edits
+ [Still so much more work to do!](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/issues?milestone=1&state=open)
+ HOMEWORK: Keep on making oneboxes for v1.1.0
