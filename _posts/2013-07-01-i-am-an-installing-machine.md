================

Welp, my dream of a [VM within a VM]({{ site.baseurl }}/2013/06/30/settin-up.html) will alas remain unfulfilled. I really couldn't get Vagrant to boot the Discourse VM without hanging. 

I've been hesitant about installing Ubuntu on my laptop, but I finally gave in and decided to [dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows](http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/05/17/how-to-dual-boot-ubuntu-12-04-and-windows-7/) at Kurtis's suggestion. Learned a bit about HD partitioning and boot loading. Bye, Linux VM and [LinuxLive USB](http://www.linuxliveusb.com/)!

I've set up my Linux dev environment yet again (probably 10th time in the last month? here's to repetition), and will try to get Discourse running by tomorrow.
