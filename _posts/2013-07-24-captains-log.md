================

>+ First time all three of us met together in a week
+ Learned about pending and pending message
	+ Used where there were methods in tests we don't understand yet and still need to rewrite
	+ Methods: expects, onebox_for_url, base_url, apply
+ Added Mocha dependency for tests
+ Fixed all remaining tests w/ RSpec, 0 failures, 14 pending
+ Learned about Travis-CI
+ Captain Kurt added travis.yml for Travis-CI
+ Travis build doesn't fail! (but the spam emails continue...)
+ HOMEWORK: Work on RGSoC blog post for Monday, due Friday!
