================
>+ Continued working on on issue [#61](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/issues/61)
  + Read up on Mustache.js vs Handlebars.js
  + No one has implemented a Ruby parser for Handlebars
  + Using mustache for onebox templates, as it has better support/integration for Ruby
  + Having a bit of trouble with _layout, using partials in layout template, and doesn't escape characters
  + Might be able to get around this with {{{}}}, but need to consider potential security issues
+ Learned new if syntax `if x then positive else negative`
+ Discussed making our own template gem, perhaps named after something other than after facial hair
+ Talked a bit about looking at performance testing as a good intro to Rails (we've really just been working in Ruby)
+ Discussed [Hate Driven Development](http://rc3.org/2009/07/14/hate-driven-development/)
+ Learned about redcarpet, upskirt, pantyshot.... would recommend against Googling....
+ HOMEWORK: Keep on making oneboxes for v1.1.0...again
