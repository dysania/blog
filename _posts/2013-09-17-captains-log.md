  + Closed previously finished readme issue
  + Made spec for HTML module with [PR #133](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/133)
  + Made spec for OpenGraph module with [PR #134](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/134)
+ Started working on Github Gist onebox, but realized we need to use JSON
