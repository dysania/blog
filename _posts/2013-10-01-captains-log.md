================
>+ pizza....pizza.... thanks, Capt'n!
+ Updated our fork of Discourse from `discourse/discourse`
  + `git fetch upstream master`
  + `git pull --rebase origin master`
  + in our case, `dysania\discourse`, fix merge conflicts since we deleted onebox related files in our copy
  + `git --rebase continue`
+ Started a discussion with Discourse team re: todo list for Onebox integration into Discourse
+ Captain Kurt started thread on meta.discourse.org
  + [Oneboxing: A Summary of the resource or the content of the result?](http://meta.discourse.org/t/oneboxing-a-summary-of-the-resource-or-the-content-of-the-result/10155)
+ Vyki added [Kinomap onebox](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/149)
+ JZ added [GitHub Blob onebox](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/150)
+ [Pull Request](https://github.com/dysania/onebox/pull/148) from new contributor to update README
  + Used `[ci skip]` to prevent tests from running, neat!
+ Discussed the origins of Rails, Basecamp, and [DHH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson)
+ 98 Stars!
+ HOMEWORK
  + Check out [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it), a rip off of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
