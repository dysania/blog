We've just survived our first presentation on contributing to Discourse!

The [LA Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Womens-Ruby-on-Rails-Group/events/134549192/)'s theme of the night was gems, and it took place at [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/)--which was [where it all started](http://railsgirls.com/la).

We were nervous, but we think we did alright. We kept it pretty short (maybe 15-20 minutes?) since we were the last to go tonight, and we did a Q&A afterward.

We made our presentation slides pretty quickly so we'd like to make some edits before we post it. :)

After the Meetup, a bunch of us went for drinks at [Tinga](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tinga-santa-monica).

Thanks to camerawoman and organizer [Jen](http://twitter.com/jendiamond), who led a [tutorial on creating gems](http://slid.es/jendiamond/createa_gem) tonight.
